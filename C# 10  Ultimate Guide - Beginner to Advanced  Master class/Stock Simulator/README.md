# Stock Simulator

A simple console application for simulating and displaying stock prices. The application demonstrates asynchronous programming in C# by generating random stock price changes and displaying updated stock data in the console. It also shows how to handle cancellation requests (e.g., when Ctrl+C is pressed) to gracefully stop the background tasks.
